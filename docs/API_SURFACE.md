# API Surface

This document lists the important names used by the warehouse simulator.

If code and documentation disagree, the code is the source of truth, but this file should be updated immediately.

## Project State

Project Name: `warehouse_simulator`

Current Version: `v0.9.2`

Previous Documented Version: `v0.9.1`

Version Meaning:

```text
v0.8.3 = v0.8.2 backend + Phase 3 run-linked actions + Setup v0.7.1 demand/layout fields + Phase 4 guided decision forms
v0.8.2 = v0.8.1 backend + Decision Frontend / Decision Web API / Decision Job API / UI refactor
```

Python Version: Python 3.13+ recommended. Pin Python 3.13 if dependency wheels are unstable on newer interpreters.

Dependencies:

```text
Flask
pandas
numpy
ECharts frontend
Optuna required for decision.optimizer and decision.multiobjective
pytest for development/testing
```

## Document Update Note for v0.9.2

This revision adds an in-app welcome page before the existing Setup workflow.

```text
Added templates/views/welcome.html
Added the welcome view to the client-side view state machine
Set the welcome view as the default initial view
Added the welcome-continue-btn transition into Setup
Updated the frontend layout styles for the welcome page
```

There are no Flask route changes. `GET /` continues to serve the application
shell, and the backend never redirects. Setup remains the functional entry point
after the welcome page.

Run Command:

```bash
python app.py
```

Health check:

```text
GET /healthz -> {"status": "ok"}
```

Production:

```bash
gunicorn app:app
```

The initial Docker deployment must use one Gunicorn worker because live simulation
state and decision jobs are process-local. Generated `data/` content should be
stored on a persistent volume and should not be committed to the repository.

Never use the Flask development server when hosted.

## Where The Project Is Now

v0.8.2 is a Decision Frontend and Job API layer built on top of the unchanged v0.8.1 Optimization and Robustness layer, the unchanged v0.8.0 Uncertainty and Risk Analysis layer, the unchanged v0.7.x Decision and Realistic Scenario layers, the unchanged v0.6.0 algorithm plugin layer, the unchanged v0.5.0 experimentation/recording/storage/analysis infrastructure, and the unchanged v0.4.0 battery/charging/failure simulation core.

v0.8.2 adds:

Decision Web API:

```text
decision/web.py
```

Purpose:

```text
Expose decision artifacts as controlled read-only JSON APIs.
```

Decision Job API:

```text
decision/jobs.py
```

Purpose:

```text
Run decision-layer jobs separately from the live experiment runner.
```

Decision Frontend:

```text
Decision Center UI
Decision Overview
Studies browser
Reports browser
Spatial analysis view
Cost KPI view
Monte Carlo browser
Sensitivity browser
Optimization browser

```

Frontend refactor:

```text
templates/index.html became a Jinja shell with view partials

Setup support for v0.7.1 demand fields:

```text
demand_mode
demand_rate_per_tick
demand_task_weights
demand_segments
demand_csv_path
demand_events
```

Setup support for v0.7.1 layout fields:

```text
layout_preset
layout_file
```

Run-linked actions from Results and Experiments:

```text
View cost KPIs from a run
View spatial bottlenecks from a run
Generate report from a run
Start Monte Carlo from a run
Start sensitivity from a run
Use run as optimizer baseline
Use run as multi-objective baseline
```

Guided decision job forms:

```text
Guided mode by default for supported modules
Advanced JSON editor preserved
Inline validation
Cost config template editors
Common constraint editors
Search-space builder for optimizer and multi-objective
Objective builder for multi-objective
Robustness candidate source selection
Study factor builder
```

The v0.8.3 frontend completes the non-CLI decision job launching workflow that was introduced in v0.8.2.

v0.8.1 adds:

Business Optimization:

```text
decision/optimizer.py
```

Optuna-based single-objective optimization with constraint handling.

Multi-Objective Optimization:

```text
decision/multiobjective.py
```

NSGA-II Pareto front generation for tradeoffs such as cost versus p95 cycle time.

Stochastic Robustness Verification:

```text
decision/robustness.py
```

Multi-replica verification of candidate configurations with constraint pass probability.

v0.8.0 adds:

Monte Carlo Runner:

```text
decision/monte_carlo.py
```

Executes N identical scenarios with varying seeds.

Calculates confidence intervals, p5/p95 KPIs, and SLA-violation probability.

Sensitivity Analysis:

```text
decision/sensitivity.py
```

One-at-a-time parameter variation around a baseline.

Outputs tornado data for `cost_per_task` and `p95_cycle_time`.

v0.7.2 adds:

Spatial bottleneck analysis:

```text
Blockage onset coordinates are recorded in events.csv and aggregated into per-cell bottleneck statistics from saved artifacts only.
```

Recorded benchmarks:

```text
benchmark.py records every run through ExperimentRunner into data/runs/<run_id>/.
```

Single-run engineering reports:

```text
decision/report.py can report one run without a study, writing to data/reports/.
```

v0.7.1 adds:

Business KPIs:

```text
Cost KPIs computed from immutable saved run artifacts.
```

Batch experimentation / Design of Experiments:

```text
Factorial study runner.
```

Engineering reporting:

```text
Markdown study reports generated from saved study results.
```

Dynamic demand profiles:

```text
Legacy synthetic demand preserved; uniform, rate schedules, and deterministic CSV/order events added.
```

Configurable layout presets:

```text
Default warehouse preserved; JSON layout definitions and preset layouts added.
```

The v0.6.0 plugin layer remains unchanged:

Path Planning:

```text
PathPlanner
BFSPathPlanner
AStarPathPlanner
```

Scheduling:

```text
Scheduler
CostBasedScheduler
PriorityScheduler
FIFOScheduler
TotalCostScheduler
AuctionScheduler
```

Conflict Resolution:

```text
ConflictManager
LocalYieldConflictManager
ZoneLockConflictManager
PrioritizedReservationConflictManager
```

The v0.5 experimentation layer is unchanged:

```text
experiment/config.py
experiment/factory.py
experiment/recorder.py
experiment/runner.py
data/runs/<run_id>/ immutable storage
analysis/loader.py
analysis/metrics.py
analysis/web.py
```

The v0.4 battery/charging/failure simulation core is unchanged.

The v0.3.1 traffic model is preserved as the `local_yield` baseline.

v0.5 separates six responsibilities:

```text
Simulation (simulation/) — v0.4 core with v0.6 plugin injection points.
Experiment configuration (experiment/config.py) — authoritative run parameters.
Metrics recorder (experiment/recorder.py) — observes, never modifies.
Experiment runner (experiment/runner.py) — lifecycle, stopping, saving.
Data storage (data/runs/<run_id>/) — immutable per-run artifacts.
Visualization/analysis (analysis/ + frontend) — reads saved data only.
```

The simulation does not depend on plotting.

The plotting system never needs live simulation objects.

A completed experiment is fully reproducible and analyzable from its saved files.

The UI is a multi-stage workflow, not one dashboard:

```text
Setup
Run live or Fast headless
Results
Experiments
Visualization
Analysis
Compare
Decision
```

View transitions are a client-side state machine; the backend never redirects.

v0.7.x and v0.8.x decision modules may execute new experiments through `ExperimentRunner`, but they must never modify existing run artifacts.

Derived decision artifacts are stored in their own directories under `data/`.

v0.8.2 decision jobs may execute backend decision modules that internally create new runs, but they must not hijack the live experiment runner.

Decision trial execution options:

```text
max_workers: integer, 1 through 4, default 1
trial_artifact_mode: "full" or "metrics_only", default "full"
```

Monte Carlo supports both modes. `full` preserves normal
`data/runs/<run_id>/` artifacts. `metrics_only` executes trials in memory,
can use spawn-based process workers, and writes only Monte Carlo decision
artifacts; its result rows use `run_id: null`. Such trials cannot be used for
spatial analysis or single-run reports.

```

Updated templates:

```text
templates/views/setup.html
templates/views/results.html
templates/views/experiments.html
templates/modals/job_modal.html
```

### Setup Changes

Setup now exposes v0.7.1 demand fields.

Recommended DOM IDs:

```text
cfg-demand-mode
cfg-demand-rate-per-tick
cfg-demand-task-weights
cfg-demand-segments
cfg-demand-csv-file
cfg-demand-events
cfg-layout-preset
cfg-layout-file
```

Conditional containers:

```text
demand-uniform-fields
demand-rate-schedule-fields
demand-csv-fields
```

`readExperimentConfig()` now includes these fields using backend snake_case keys.

Demand mode behavior:

```text
legacy:
no additional demand fields

uniform:
demand_rate_per_tick
demand_task_weights

rate_schedule:
demand_segments

csv_orders:
demand_csv_path
demand_events
```

Layout behavior:

```text
layout_preset is exposed.
layout_file is exposed as an optional local trusted relative path input.
```

Important file policy:

```text
Demand CSV and layout file inputs are currently local trusted relative-path inputs.
They are acceptable for local single-user development.
For hosted deployments, they must be replaced by admin-managed dropdowns or validated uploads.
```

### Decision Job Modal Changes

The decision job modal now supports guided mode.

New modal IDs:

```text
decision-job-use-guided
decision-job-guided
decision-job-json-wrapper
decision-job-toggle-json
decision-job-guided-error
```

Guided behavior:

```text
When guided mode is enabled, the modal renders a module-specific guided form.
When guided mode is disabled, the modal uses the raw JSON editor.
When a Phase 3 run-linked action supplies a prefilled config object, the modal opens in advanced JSON mode.
Guided forms do not attempt to reverse-parse arbitrary Phase 3 JSON back into guided controls.
```

### Run-Linked Action Changes

Results now contains a decision action card:

```text
results-decision-actions-card
```

Run-linked actions use:

```text
data-run-action
data-run-id
```

Supported `data-run-action` values:

```text
cost
spatial
report
monte_carlo
sensitivity
optimizer
multiobjective
```

Behavior:

```text
cost:
opens Decision -> Cost KPIs and selects the run

spatial:
opens Decision -> Spatial and selects the run

report:
opens job modal with report config

monte_carlo:
opens job modal with Monte Carlo config prefilled from run

sensitivity:
opens job modal with sensitivity config prefilled from run

optimizer:
opens job modal with optimizer config prefilled from run

multiobjective:
opens job modal with multi-objective config prefilled from run
```

### v0.8.3 Non-Changes

```text
No simulation core changes.
No `ExperimentConfig` schema changes.
No decision math changes.
No decision job API route changes.
No decision math moved to the frontend.
No stored run artifact format changes.
No changes to Monte Carlo, sensitivity, optimizer, multi-objective, or robustness backend schemas.
```

## Phase 5 Decision Charts

Dedicated chart payload routes avoid sending full trial artifacts to the browser:

```text
GET /api/decision/monte-carlo/<mc_id>/charts/histograms
GET /api/decision/sensitivity/<study_id>/tornado
GET /api/decision/optimizations/<opt_id>/charts/objective
GET /api/decision/multiobjective/<study_id>/charts/pareto
GET /api/decision/robustness/<robust_id>/charts/pass-probability
```

Chart route behavior:

```text
Monte Carlo validates metrics and clamps bins to 5..100; bins and counts are computed by the backend.
Sensitivity tornado rows are sorted by absolute delta and include the OAT interaction warning.
Optimizer objective payloads include feasible flags and a best trial number only when a feasible best trial exists.
Multi-objective payloads select the first two objectives by default and include backend Pareto membership.
Robustness payloads include threshold, pass status, recommendation state, and low-replication warnings.
```

Chart wrappers live in `static/js/charts.js`; Decision detail views consume these payloads for the five Phase 5 charts.

```

Current persistence policy:

```text
job metadata is persisted in data/decision_jobs.json
queued/running jobs recovered after Flask restart are marked failed with an interruption message
generated artifacts remain on disk
```

Job progress is exposed as:

```json
{"percent": 5, "message": "Validating and preparing job."}
```

Decision reports can be downloaded as PDF. The PDF contains the Markdown report plus a generated KPI visualization when the source study or run has numeric result data:

```text
GET /api/decision/reports/<report_id>/download.pdf
```

The template endpoint returns an Advanced JSON starter config for each supported job module. The file endpoints provide a local data/uploads listing and multipart upload for trusted local development workflows.

### Flask Layer

`app.py` UPDATED in v0.8.2.

Added imports:

```python
from decision.web import create_decision_blueprint
from decision.jobs import DecisionJobManager, create_decision_jobs_blueprint
```

Added decision data root:

```python
base_dir = Path(base_data_dir)
data_dir = base_dir.parent
```

For default configuration:

```text
base_dir = data/runs
data_dir = data
```

Added decision job manager:

```python
decision_job_manager = DecisionJobManager(
    data_dir=data_dir,
    runs_dir=base_dir,
    max_workers=1,
)
```

Registered decision blueprints:

```python
app.register_blueprint(
    create_decision_blueprint(
        data_dir=data_dir,
        runs_dir=base_dir,
    )
)

app.register_blueprint(
    create_decision_jobs_blueprint(decision_job_manager)
)
```

Existing routes remain unchanged:

```text
GET /
GET /api/state
POST /api/pause
POST /api/resume
POST /api/reset

POST /api/experiment/start
GET /api/experiment/state
POST /api/experiment/stop
GET /api/experiment/summary

GET /api/runs
DELETE /api/runs/<run_id>
GET /api/runs/compare/series
GET /api/runs/<run_id>/summary
GET /api/runs/<run_id>/series
GET /api/runs/<run_id>/distributions
```

### Frontend Layer

The frontend was refactored from monolithic files into modular files.

Deprecated monolithic files:

```text
templates/index.html as a single giant file
static/style.css as a single giant file
static/simulation.js as a single giant file
```

New frontend structure:

```text
templates/
├── index.html
├── views/
│   ├── setup.html
│   ├── run.html
│   ├── fast.html
│   ├── results.html
│   ├── experiments.html
│   ├── visualization.html
│   ├── analysis.html
│   ├── compare.html
│   └── decision.html
└── modals/
    └── job_modal.html

static/
├── css/
│   ├── theme.css
│   ├── layout.css
│   ├── warehouse.css
│   └── decision.css
└── js/
    ├── utils.js
    ├── state.js
    ├── charts.js
    ├── warehouse.js
    ├── experiments.js
    ├── decision.js
    ├── decision_forms.js
    └── app.js
```

Important note:

```text
The ECharts wrapper module is static/js/charts.js.
If a local file was accidentally named chart.js, it must be renamed to charts.js or the script tag must be corrected.

Important note:
`static/js/decision_forms.js` must load after `static/js/decision.js` and before `static/js/app.js`.
It overrides guided job modal behavior, including `openJobModal` and `submitJob`.
```

Correct script load order:

```html
<script src="/static/js/utils.js"></script>
<script src="/static/js/state.js"></script>
<script src="/static/js/charts.js"></script>
<script src="/static/js/warehouse.js"></script>
<script src="/static/js/experiments.js"></script>
<script src="/static/js/decision.js"></script>
<script src="/static/js/decision_forms.js"></script>
<script src="/static/js/app.js"></script>
```

ECharts must load before the JS modules that render charts.

CDN form:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/echarts@5/dist/echarts.min.js"></script>
```

Offline/vendored form:

```html
<script src="/static/vendor/echarts.min.js"></script>
```

### v0.8.2 Non-Changes

No simulation core changes.

No `ExperimentConfig` schema changes.

No changes to decision math modules.

No changes to stored run artifact format.

No changes to Monte Carlo, sensitivity, optimizer, multi-objective, or robustness backend schemas.

No decision math moved to the frontend.

### v0.8.3 Known Limitations

Frontend limitations:

```text
Advanced decision charts are not implemented yet.
Spatial heatmap overlay is not implemented yet.
Demand CSV and layout file selection use local trusted relative-path text inputs, not managed dropdowns or uploads.
Guided robustness supports multi-objective study IDs and explicit candidates JSON, but not direct optimizer-summary import.
Guided forms do not parse arbitrary Phase 3 prefilled JSON back into guided controls; Phase 3 prefills open in Advanced JSON mode.
Study guided form supports simple factor entry, but does not yet provide factorial-size estimation or advanced DoE validation.
```

Job system limitations:

```text
Job state is in-memory only.
Jobs are lost from the UI on Flask restart.
Running jobs cannot be cancelled.
Progress reporting is not implemented.
Template endpoints are not implemented.
File selection/upload endpoints are not implemented.
```

Decision API limitations:

```text
Cost KPI endpoint currently accepts cost config as URL-encoded JSON.
Report indexing currently focuses on data/reports single-run reports.
Study report browsing may require navigation through study detail depending on implementation.
Spatial jobs do not currently produce a dedicated stored artifact directory.
```

## Breaking Changes / Changes From v0.3.1 (v0.4.0)

### Core Architecture

Added `simulation/config.py` containing `BatteryConfig`, `ChargingConfig`, and `FailureConfig`.

Added `simulation/charging.py` containing `ChargingStation`.

`Simulation` constructor now accepts keyword-only v0.4 arguments:

```text
battery_config
charging_config
failure_config
seed
```

`Simulation` now owns:

```text
charging-station state
maintenance-cell scanning
failure RNG
dynamic resume-location tracking
congestion snapshots
```

Added:

```text
task interruption, recovery, and reassignment logic
battery drain from actual movement
loaded movement consuming more energy than empty movement
critical battery, opportunistic charging, and empty-battery recovery
robot failures, repair time, and maintenance relocation
battery urgency in yield scoring
taskless routing helper _route_robot_to_cell() for charger and maintenance movement
```

### Data Models

`Robot` gained `RobotMode` and v0.4 battery/charging/failure fields.

`Task` gained:

```text
LoadState
INTERRUPTED status
interruption count
last-assigned robot
resume-location fields
```

`Metrics` gained battery, charging, waiting-breakdown, interruption, failure, and congestion-related fields/methods.

### Frontend / CLI

`benchmark.py` accepts v0.4 battery, charging, and failure parameters.

`optimize_optuna.py` accepts fixed v0.4 parameters and optional `--search-v04` mode.

Frontend supports:

```text
Interrupted tasks
robot mode/battery tooltips
v0.4 dashboard metrics
```

CSS adds styles for interrupted tasks and robot battery/charging/failure states.

---

## Breaking Changes / Changes From v0.4.0 (v0.5.0)

```text
config.py
factory.py
recorder.py
runner.py
```

Added `analysis/` package:

```python
holder = {
    "simulation": ...,
    "runner": ...
}
```

The v0.4 closure-based single-simulation wiring is gone.

`create_default_simulation()` replaced by:

```python
create_simulation_from_config(ExperimentConfig.default())
```

Robot creation is dynamic and seeded; old hardcoded 13-position list gone.

No robot-count cap beyond available passable cells.

`ExperimentConfig` gained:

```text
display_name
fast_mode
```

`display_name` is label only.

`fast_mode` affects pacing only; fast_mode never affects results.

## Breaking Changes / Changes From v0.5.0 (v0.6.0)

### Core Architecture

`simulation/pathfinding.py` UPDATED:

Added:

```text
PathPlanner protocol
BFSPathPlanner
AStarPathPlanner
```

`find_shortest_path()` preserved as backward-compatible wrapper delegating to `BFSPathPlanner`.

`simulation/scheduler.py` UPDATED:

Added:

```text
PriorityScheduler
FIFOScheduler
TotalCostScheduler
AuctionScheduler
```

Existing:

```text
CostBasedScheduler
```

All implement the `Scheduler` protocol.

Added `simulation/conflict.py` containing:

```text
ConflictManager protocol
LocalYieldConflictManager
ZoneLockConflictManager
PrioritizedReservationConflictManager
```

Added `simulation/reservations.py` containing:

```text
ReservationTable
```

`Simulation` constructor gained keyword-only:

```text
path_planner
```

`Simulation` gained:

```python
set_conflict_manager()
```

`Simulation` gained internal state:

```text
_conflict_manager
```

Initialized to:

```python
LocalYieldConflictManager(self)
```

`Simulation._tick()` now calls:

```python
self._conflict_manager.tick()
```

before:

```python
_advance_robots()
```

`Simulation._advance_robots()` now calls:

```python
self._conflict_manager.allow_step()
```

before the occupied-cell check.

`Simulation._congestion_snapshot()` reads:

```python
self._conflict_manager.active_conflicts
```

All conflict-related private methods moved from `Simulation` into `LocalYieldConflictManager`.

### Experiment Configuration

`ExperimentConfig` gained:

```text
path_planner: str = "bfs"
conflict_manager: str = "local_yield"
```

`ExperimentConfig.__post_init__` validates:

```text
path_planner against PATH_PLANNER_CHOICES
conflict_manager against CONFLICT_MANAGER_CHOICES
```

### Factory

`experiment/factory.py` gained:

```text
create_path_planner_from_name(name)
create_scheduler_from_name(name, path_planner)
create_conflict_manager_from_name(name, sim)
create_path_planner(config)
create_scheduler(config, path_planner)
create_conflict_manager(config, sim)
```

`create_simulation_from_config()` now creates and injects the configured scheduler, path planner, and conflict manager.

### CLI

`benchmark.py` gained:

```text
--path-planner
--scheduler
--conflict-manager
```

Choices:

```text
path-planner: bfs, astar, weighted_astar
scheduler: baseline, priority, fifo, total_cost, auction
conflict-manager: local_yield, zone_locks, priority_reservation
```

Defaults:

```text
--path-planner bfs
--scheduler baseline
--conflict-manager local_yield
```

`benchmark.py` prints active path planner, scheduler, and conflict manager class names before running.

`benchmark.py` prints conflict manager diagnostics after running.

### Frontend

Setup view gained three algorithm dropdowns:

```text
cfg-path-planner
cfg-scheduler
cfg-conflict-manager
```

Setup view uses `.setup-grid` two-column card layout.

Run view restructured:

```text
.run-layout flex container
.run-main warehouse/legend
.run-sidebar controls/dashboard/task list
```

Pause/Resume/Reset buttons moved to `.run-controls` at top of sidebar.

`readExperimentConfig()` includes:

```text
path_planner
scheduler
conflict_manager
```

### CSS

Added:

```text
.setup-grid
.setup-grid .card

## Breaking Changes / Changes From v0.6.0 (v0.7.1)

### Decision Layer

Added `decision/` package.

`decision/cost.py`:

```text
CostConfig dataclass for run-level business costs.
```

`decision/kpis.py`:

```text
CostKPIs
compute_cost_kpis()
compute_cost_kpis_for_run_id()
```

Reads saved artifacts only.

`decision/study.py`:

```text
StudyConfig
StudyRunner
```

Executes factorial DoE matrices and outputs:

```text
data/studies/<study_id>/results.csv
```

`decision/report.py`:

```text
generate_report()
```

Generates Markdown engineering reports from study results.

`decision/demand.py`:

```text
DemandConfig
DemandModel
DemandTaskGenerator
```

Supports:

```text
legacy
uniform
rate_schedule
csv_orders
```

`decision/layout.py`:

```text
LayoutConfig
PRESET_LAYOUTS
```

Supports:

```text
default
high_density
one_way_aisles
```

### Experiment Configuration

`ExperimentConfig` gained additive v0.7.1 fields with backward-compatible defaults:

```text
demand_mode
demand_rate_per_tick
demand_task_weights
demand_segments
demand_csv_path
demand_events
layout_preset
layout_file
```

`ExperimentConfig.__post_init__` validates demand and layout fields.

### Factory

`experiment/factory.py` gained:

```text
create_task_generator(config, warehouse)
```

`create_simulation_from_config()` now builds the warehouse using:

```python
decision.layout.create_warehouse_for_experiment()
```

and the task generator using:

```python
create_task_generator()
```

Default behavior remains unchanged.

### Storage Format

Run storage structure is unchanged.

`config.json` gained the new v0.7.1 keys.

New study storage layout added under:

```text
data/studies/<study_id>/
```

---

## Breaking Changes / Changes From v0.7.1 (v0.7.2)

### Experiment Layer

`ExperimentRunner._snapshot()` now extracts per-robot `x` and `y`.

`MetricsRecorder` writes:

```json
{"x": ..., "y": ...}
```

JSON into the `details` column of `robot_blocked` events.

`events.csv` schema is unchanged.

### Decision Layer

Added `decision/spatial.py`:

```text
SpatialCellLoad
SpatialBlockageResult
compute_spatial_blockage()
top_bottleneck_cells()
_pair_blocked_episodes()
```

`decision/report.py` gained:

```python
generate_run_report(run_id, base_dir=None)
```

Single-run reports are written to:

```text
data/reports/<run_id>_report.md
```

Never inside:

```text
data/runs/
```

Study reports gained a Spatial Bottleneck Analysis section.

`python -m decision.report` gained:

```text
--run-id
--base-dir
```

`--run-id` is mutually exclusive with `--study-dir`.

### Decision CLI

Added:

```bash
python -m decision.spatial --run-id <run_id>
```

Options:

```text
--base-dir
--top
--by blocked_ticks|blocked_events
--json
```

### CLI Layer

`benchmark.py` now records every run through `ExperimentRunner`.

Benchmark wall-clock times are no longer comparable to pre-v0.7.2 runs due to recording overhead.

### Storage

Run storage structure is unchanged.

Pre-v0.7.2 runs have empty `details` on `robot_blocked` rows.

Spatial analysis reports them with coverage 0.0.

Added:

```text
data/reports/
```

for single-run Markdown reports.

`results.csv` carries `run_id` so each study row traces back to:

```text
data/runs/<run_id>/
```

---

## Breaking Changes / Changes From v0.7.2 (v0.8.0)

### Decision Layer

Added:

```text
decision/monte_carlo.py

Executes N identical experiment configurations with different seeds.
Calculates confidence intervals, p5/p95 KPIs, and SLA violation statistics.
Writes derived artifacts to data/monte_carlo/<mc_id>/.
Each trial writes a normal immutable run artifact to data/runs/<run_id>/.
```

Sensitivity:

```text
Performs one-at-a-time parameter variation around a baseline configuration.
Uses multiple replications per factor level.
Writes results.csv, tornado.csv, and summary.json to data/sensitivity/<study_id>/.
Each non-reused trial writes a normal immutable run artifact to data/runs/<run_id>/.
```

No simulation core changes.

No `ExperimentConfig` schema changes.

No frontend changes at the time.

---

## Breaking Changes / Changes From v0.8.0 (v0.8.1)

### Decision Layer

Added:

```text
decision/optimizer.py
decision/multiobjective.py
decision/robustness.py
```

Single-objective optimization:

```text
Optuna TPESampler.
Constraint handling through Optuna constraints_func.
Explicit feasible/infeasible reporting.
Writes data/optimizations/<opt_id>/summary.json.
```

Multi-objective optimization:

```text
Optuna NSGAIISampler.
Pareto front extraction from feasible trials.
Writes data/multiobjective/<study_id>/summary.json, trials.json, and pareto.csv.
```

Robustness verification:

```text
Multi-replica candidate verification.
Calculates constraint_pass_probability.
Recommends candidates only when constraint pass probability meets min_pass_probability.
Writes data/robustness/<robust_id>/results.csv and summary.json.
```

No simulation core changes.

No `ExperimentConfig` schema changes.

No frontend changes at the time.

Optuna becomes required for optimization modules.

---

## Important Code Default Note

The actual v0.3.1 code defaults are:

```text
blocked_replan_seconds = 0.7
replan_cooldown_ticks = 7
```

Older documentation may mention `0.9` and `2`.

The code defaults are the source of truth.

---

## Coordinate System

Coordinates are `(x, y)`.

```text
x increases to the right.
y increases downward.
Origin is the top-left corner.
```

---

## Naming Rules

### Python

```text
Classes use PascalCase.
Functions and variables use snake_case.
Private methods start with _.
Enum members use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
```

### Stored Experiment Config

Stored `config.json` keys use `snake_case` because they map directly to `ExperimentConfig` fields.

### Live Frontend JSON API

Live `/api/state` and related frontend payloads use the established camelCase keys from v0.4/v0.5/v0.6.

Decision-layer payloads added in v0.8.2 preserve backend snake_case keys.

### JavaScript

```text
Functions and variables use camelCase.
DOM element variables usually end with El.
```

---

## Python Modules

### `simulation/config.py`, NEW in v0.4.0

Configuration dataclasses for v0.4 features.

#### `BatteryConfig`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class BatteryConfig
```

Fields:

```text
capacity: float = 100.0
empty_move_energy: float = 0.35
loaded_move_energy: float = 0.5
critical_battery: float = 15.0
opportunistic_charge_threshold: float = 30.0
idle_ticks_before_opportunistic_charge: int = 10
safety_margin: float = 5.0
empty_battery_recovery_ticks: int = 15
```

Methods:

```text
move_cost(loaded: bool) -> float
is_critical(battery: float) -> bool
is_opportunistic_candidate(battery: float) -> bool
```

Important behavior:

```text
empty_move_energy is consumed per successful empty movement step.
loaded_move_energy is consumed per successful loaded movement step.
Battery consumption must come from actual movement, not elapsed time.
critical_battery forces charging behavior.
opportunistic_charge_threshold allows idle robots to charge after the idle threshold.
safety_margin is added to estimated remaining task energy during feasibility checks.
empty_battery_recovery_ticks is the minimum downtime when battery reaches zero.
```

#### `ChargingConfig`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ChargingConfig
```

Fields:

```text
capacity: int = 4
charge_duration_ticks: int = 10
```

Important behavior:

```text
capacity is logical station capacity.
Physical CHARGING cells can further constrain simultaneous charging.
If the map has fewer usable charging cells than capacity, effective physical charging may be lower.
```

#### `FailureConfig`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class FailureConfig
```

Fields:

```text
enabled: bool = False
mtbf_ticks: float = 0.0
mttr_ticks: int = 25
seed: int | None = None
relocate_to_maintenance: bool = True
```

Important behavior:

```text
mtbf_ticks <= 0 disables random failures.
mttr_ticks is repair duration.
If relocate_to_maintenance is true, failed/dead robots are moved/towed to a MAINTENANCE cell.
If false, failed robots remain where they failed and become obstacles.
```

---

### `simulation/charging.py`, NEW in v0.4.0

Finite-capacity charging resource model.

#### `ChargingStation`

```python
@dataclass
class ChargingStation
```

Fields:

```text
capacity: int
charge_duration_ticks: int
active: dict[str, int]
active_cells: dict[str, tuple[int, int]]
reserved_cells: dict[str, tuple[int, int]]
waiting: set[str]
```

Meaning:

```text
active — robot_id -> remaining charging ticks.
active_cells — robot_id -> charging cell.
reserved_cells — robot_id -> reserved cell.
waiting — robot ids waiting for charger capacity.
```

Properties:

```text
occupancy -> int
has_capacity -> bool
```

Methods:

```text
is_charging(robot_id: str) -> bool
is_waiting(robot_id: str) -> bool
add_waiting(robot_id: str) -> None
remove_waiting(robot_id: str) -> None
reserve(robot_id: str, cell: tuple[int, int]) -> bool
release_reservation(robot_id: str) -> None
begin_charging(robot_id: str, cell: tuple[int, int]) -> bool
release(robot_id: str) -> None
is_cell_active(cell: tuple[int, int]) -> bool
is_cell_reserved(cell: tuple[int, int]) -> bool
tick() -> list[str]
```

Important behavior:

```text
Active robots occupy capacity.
Waiting robots do not occupy capacity.
Reserved robots hold capacity while traveling to a charging cell.
has_capacity accounts for active plus reserved robots.
begin_charging() converts a reservation into active charging, or takes an unreserved slot if capacity allows.
tick() advances charging timers and returns robot ids that finished.
```

---

### `simulation/warehouse.py`

#### `CellType`

```python
class CellType(str, Enum)
```

Members:

```text
EMPTY
SHELF
AISLE
MAIN_AISLE
PACKING
RECEIVING
SHIPPING
CHARGING
INTERSECTION
BUFFER
PICK_STATION
CONSOLIDATION
STAGING
MAINTENANCE
```

Values should be the same as member names:

```python
CellType.EMPTY.value == "EMPTY"
CellType.SHELF.value == "SHELF"
CellType.CHARGING.value == "CHARGING"
CellType.MAINTENANCE.value == "MAINTENANCE"
```

Important:

```text
Enum values and layout symbol keys must not contain trailing spaces.
Correct: "EMPTY", not "EMPTY ".
Correct: ".", not ". ".
```

#### `LAYOUT_SYMBOLS`

```python
LAYOUT_SYMBOLS: dict[str, CellType]
```

Supported layout symbols:

```text
. -> EMPTY
E -> EMPTY
# -> SHELF
a -> AISLE
M -> MAIN_AISLE
P -> PACKING
R -> RECEIVING
S -> SHIPPING
C -> CHARGING
I -> INTERSECTION
B -> BUFFER
K -> PICK_STATION
O -> CONSOLIDATION
G -> STAGING
X -> MAINTENANCE
```

#### `Location`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Location
```

Fields:

```text
location.name: str
location.cell: tuple[int, int]
location.access: tuple[int, int]
```

Meaning:

```text
cell is the physical cell the location represents.
access is the passable cell an AMR actually drives to.
```

#### `Warehouse`

```python
class Warehouse
```

Constructor:

```python
Warehouse(
    layout: Iterable[str],
    locations: Mapping[str, Location] | None = None,
)
```

Public attributes:

```text
warehouse.width: int
warehouse.height: int
warehouse.layout: list[list[CellType]]
warehouse.locations: dict[str, Location]
```

Public methods:

```text
warehouse.in_bounds(x: int, y: int) -> bool
warehouse.cell_type(x: int, y: int) -> CellType
warehouse.is_blocked(x: int, y: int) -> bool
warehouse.resolve(name: str) -> tuple[int, int]
warehouse.to_dict() -> dict[str, Any]
```

Property:

```text
warehouse.obstacles -> frozenset[tuple[int, int]]
```

Private methods:

```text
warehouse._parse_layout(layout) -> list[list[CellType]]
warehouse._validate() -> None
warehouse._rack_anchors() -> dict[str, list[int]]
```

Important behavior:

```text
is_blocked() returns True for out-of-bounds cells.
is_blocked() returns True for SHELF cells.
All other cell types are passable.
resolve() returns the location's access coordinate and raises KeyError for unknown names.
_validate() checks that every location's cell and access are in bounds and that access is not blocked.
_rack_anchors() returns one anchor cell per rack letter.
```

v0.4 dynamically adds `RESUME-*` locations to `warehouse.locations` during simulation runtime for interrupted loaded tasks.

`Simulation.get_state()` should strip dynamic `RESUME-*` locations from the serialized warehouse payload to avoid unnecessary frontend rebuilds.

---

### `simulation/robot.py`, UPDATED in v0.4.0

#### `RobotStatus`

```python
class RobotStatus(str, Enum)
```

Members:

```text
IDLE = "Idle"

```python
class RobotMode(str, Enum)
```

Members:

```text
IDLE
MOVING
TO_CHARGER
WAITING_FOR_CHARGER
CHARGING
FAILED
REPAIRING
```

Important behavior:

```text
RobotStatus remains backward compatible with v0.3 UI consumers.
RobotMode carries richer v0.4 operational state.
A robot may have status == Idle while mode == Charging or mode == Waiting for charger.
```

#### `Robot`

```python
@dataclass
class Robot
```

Existing fields:

```text
robot.id: str
robot.x: int
robot.y: int
robot.color: str
robot.status: RobotStatus

```

Property:

```text
robot.current_target -> tuple[int, int] | None
```

Public methods:

```text
robot.set_path(path: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> None
robot.set_temporary_path(path: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> None
robot.advance() -> bool
robot.to_dict() -> dict[str, Any]
```

Important behavior:

```text
set_path() expects a path excluding the robot's current cell.
advance() moves the robot one cell.
advance() returns True when the robot reaches the end of its path.
route_goal is the current final destination for the robot's current task phase or taskless movement target.
travel_history stores previously visited cells and is used for backtracking during yield maneuvers.
battery must never become negative.
idle_ticks is used for opportunistic charging.
charger_wait_ticks counts waiting for charger capacity, not active charging time.
interrupted_task_id allows a robot to attempt to reclaim its own interrupted task after charging/repair if the task is still unassigned.
```

---

### `simulation/task.py`, UPDATED in v0.4.0

#### `TaskType`

```python
class TaskType(str, Enum)
```

Members:

```text

```

`INTERRUPTED` is NEW in v0.4.0.

#### `TaskPhase`

```python
class TaskPhase(str, Enum)
```

Members:

```text
TO_PICKUP = "To pickup"
TO_DROPOFF = "To dropoff"
DONE = "Done"
```

#### `LoadState`, NEW in v0.4.0

```python
class LoadState(str, Enum)
```

Members:

```text
ON_SHELF = "On shelf"
CARRIED = "Carried"
STAGED = "Staged"
DELIVERED = "Delivered"
```

Important behavior:

```text
LoadState is a logical cargo state, not full physical pallet handling.
If a loaded task is interrupted, the load remains associated with the task and is logically staged at a resume location.
```

#### `Task`

```python
@dataclass
class Task
```

Existing fields:

```text
task.id: str
task.name: str
task.pickup: str
task.dropoff: str
task.task_type: TaskType
task.priority: int
task.created_at: int
task.completed_at: int | None
task.status: TaskStatus
task.assigned_robot_id: str | None
task.phase: TaskPhase
```

New v0.4 fields:

```text
task.load_state: LoadState
task.interruption_count: int
task.last_assigned_robot_id: str | None
task.resume_location_name: str | None
```

Public methods:

```text
task.to_dict() -> dict[str, Any]
```

Important behavior:

```text
pickup and dropoff are location names, resolved to coordinates via warehouse.resolve().
If a loaded task is interrupted, pickup may be rewritten to a temporary RESUME-* location name.
INTERRUPTED tasks remain claimable by another robot.
interruption_count supports reassignment metrics.
last_assigned_robot_id supports reassignment detection.
```

---

### `simulation/task_generator.py`

#### `TaskGenerator`

```python
@dataclass
class TaskGenerator
```

Constructor fields:

```text
warehouse: Warehouse
start_tick: int = 2
seed: int | None = None
```

Public methods:

```text
task_generator.step(tick: int) -> list[Task]
task_generator.reset() -> None
```

Private methods:

```text
_refresh_location_cache() -> None
_create_task(task_type: TaskType, tick: int) -> Task
_pick_one(values: list[str], fallback: str | None = None) -> str
_priority_for(task_type: TaskType) -> int
_interval_for(task_type: TaskType) -> int
```

Important behavior:

```text
Generates tasks during the simulation instead of seeding all work at startup.
Emits a light stream of PUTAWAY, PICK, PACK, and SHIP tasks using existing named locations.
```

Priority mapping, lower number = higher priority:

```text
SHIP = 0
PACK = 1
PICK = 2
PUTAWAY = 3
```

If `seed` is an int, random location selection is reproducible.

If `seed` is None, deterministic round-robin behavior is preserved.

Reset re-seeds with the same seed.

---

### `simulation/pathfinding.py`, UPDATED in v0.6.0

#### `PathPlanner`, NEW in v0.6.0

```python
class PathPlanner(Protocol)
```

Method:

```python
find_path(warehouse, start, goal, blocked_cells=None) -> list[tuple[int, int]] | None
```

Return meaning:

```text
[] — already at the goal.
[...] — path cells after start.
None — no path found.
```

#### `BFSPathPlanner`, NEW in v0.6.0

```python
class BFSPathPlanner
```

Implements `PathPlanner`.

Uses BFS.

Returns shortest paths.

This is the default planner and produces identical results to the v0.5 `find_shortest_path`.

#### `AStarPathPlanner`, NEW in v0.6.0

```python
class AStarPathPlanner
```

Constructor:

```python
AStarPathPlanner(weight: float = 1.0)
```

Implements `PathPlanner`.

Uses A* with Manhattan heuristic.

```text
weight = 1.0: Standard A*. On a uniform 4-connected grid, returns shortest paths like BFS, but may choose a different shortest path when ties exist.
weight > 1.0: Weighted A*. Faster search, but paths may be suboptimal.
```

#### `find_shortest_path`, preserved

```python
find_shortest_path(
    warehouse: Warehouse,
    start: tuple[int, int],
    goal: tuple[int, int],
    blocked_cells: Iterable[tuple[int, int]] | None = None,
) -> list[tuple[int, int]] | None
```

Backward-compatible wrapper.

Delegates to a module-level `BFSPathPlanner` instance.

Existing modules that still import `find_shortest_path` will keep working.

New code should use an injected `PathPlanner` instead.

---

#### `PriorityScheduler`, NEW in v0.6.0

```python
class PriorityScheduler
```

Nearest-pickup dispatcher with correct priority ordering.

Processes tasks by:

```text
(priority, created_at, id)
```

where lower `priority` value = higher urgency.

For each task, assigns the nearest feasible robot to the pickup.

#### `FIFOScheduler`, NEW in v0.6.0

```python
class FIFOScheduler
```

Nearest-pickup dispatcher that processes oldest tasks first.

Processes tasks by:

```text
(created_at, priority, id)
```

For each task, assigns the nearest feasible robot to the pickup.

#### `TotalCostScheduler`, NEW in v0.6.0

```python

```

#### `LocalYieldConflictManager`

```python
class LocalYieldConflictManager
```

Constructor:

```python
LocalYieldConflictManager(sim: Simulation)
```

Baseline reactive conflict manager.

Contains all the v0.3.1 traffic/conflict resolution logic previously in `Simulation`.

`tick()` and `allow_step()` are no-ops.

`release_robot()` is a no-op.

Important behavior:

```text
Preserves the v0.3.1 local deadlock-recovery mechanism exactly.
handle_blocked_robot(), advance_replanning_robot(), release_conflict(), clear_conflicts_for_robot() implement the existing yield logic.
_make_robot_yield(), _select_yielding_robot(), _yield_score(), _can_yield(), _choose_yield_step() are private helpers.
_complete_yield() resumes normal routing after a yield maneuver.
```

#### `ZoneLockConflictManager`, NEW in v0.6.0

```python
class ZoneLockConflictManager
```

Constructor:

```python
ZoneLockConflictManager(sim: Simulation, lookahead: int = 2)
```

Inherits from `LocalYieldConflictManager`.

Adds proactive path-corridor zone locks on top of the reactive local yield system.

Important behavior:

```text
tick() rebuilds zone locks from each robot's current path.
Claims the next lookahead cells on each robot's path.
Robots are sorted by _yield_score(); less willing to yield claims first.
allow_step() denies a step if the target cell is locked by another robot, unless the robot has been blocked for too long.
Starvation fallback: blocked_ticks >= blocked_replan_threshold_ticks * 2.
Failed, repairing, and charging robots do not create claims.
```

Diagnostic counters:

```text
denied_steps
locks_created
tick_calls
robots_with_paths
```

#### `PrioritizedReservationConflictManager`, NEW in v0.6.0

```python
class PrioritizedReservationConflictManager
```

Constructor:

```python
PrioritizedReservationConflictManager(sim: Simulation, horizon: int = 32)
```

Inherits from `LocalYieldConflictManager`.

Adds approximate prioritized reservation-based conflict management on top of the reactive local yield system.

Important behavior:

```text
tick() rebuilds vertex reservations from each robot's current path using a ReservationTable.
Robots are sorted by a priority score. Higher score reserves first.
Priority score considers robot mode, task priority, loaded status, battery urgency, and blocked time.
allow_step() denies a step if the target cell is reserved by another robot at the next tick, unless the robot has been blocked for too long.
Starvation fallback: blocked_ticks >= blocked_replan_threshold_ticks * 2.
Failed, repairing, and charging robots do not create reservations.
```

Diagnostic counters:

```text
denied_steps
reservations_created
tick_calls
robots_with_paths
```

This is not full space-time MAPF.

It is a practical proactive traffic manager for experimentation.

### `simulation/reservations.py`, NEW in v0.6.0

#### `ReservationTable`

```python
class ReservationTable
```

Simple vertex reservation table.

Tracks which robot intends to occupy which cell at which tick.

Does not track edge reservations, so swap collisions are not fully covered.

Fields:

```text
_vertex_reservations: dict[tuple[int, int], dict[int, str]]
_robot_reservations: dict[str, set[tuple[tuple[int, int], int]]]
```

Meaning:

Important internal state:

Existing:

```text

```text
simulation._path_planner
simulation._conflict_manager
```

Defaults:

```text
_path_planner defaults to BFSPathPlanner()
_conflict_manager defaults to LocalYieldConflictManager(self)
```

Important behavior:

```text
start() starts the background simulation thread.
pause() stops ticking but keeps state.
resume() continues ticking.
reset() restores robots and tasks to their initial state, clears conflict manager state via self._conflict_manager.reset(), clears dynamic resume locations, resets charging station state, resets failure RNG, and restores robot batteries/modes.
set_conflict_manager() replaces the active conflict manager and rebinds its _sim reference.
get_state() returns a JSON-serializable snapshot.
get_state() should strip dynamic RESUME-* locations from the warehouse payload.
_tick() runs failures/repairs, charging station progression, task generation, assignment, battery checks, opportunistic charging, conflict manager tick, robot movement, metrics, and pruning.
_advance_robots() calls self._conflict_manager.allow_step() before the occupied-cell check. Replanning/yielding robots are NOT gated by allow_step() so deadlock escape still works.
_prune_old_tasks() deletes completed/failed tasks whose completed_at is more than 100 ticks old. Interrupted tasks are not pruned.
```

---

## Traffic / Conflict Resolution Behavior

### v0.3.1 Local Yield, preserved as `local_yield`

When a robot's next cell is occupied by another robot, the blocked robot increments `blocked_ticks`.

After `blocked_replan_seconds` the conflict becomes eligible for yielding.

For each blocking pair, only one robot may replan at a time.

The selected yielder is stored in `_active_conflict_yielder`.

The non-yielding robot's route is frozen during the conflict.

The yielding robot receives a local yield step from `_choose_yield_step()`.

Yield step preference:

```text
A neighboring cell that still allows reaching the current route_goal.
A backtrack step through recent travel_history.
Any safe escape neighbor, biased away from the blocker.
```

A valid yield step must be:

```text
in bounds
not a shelf
not occupied
not claimed by another robot's immediate next target
```

If the preferred yielder is stationary it can be forced to yield.

If the preferred yielder cannot act quickly enough, the blocked robot yields instead.

If the active yielder appears inactive for too long, the blocked robot takes over.

`_can_yield()` prevents a robot from participating in more than one active conflict and enforces `replan_cooldown`.

`_attempt_resume_route()` resumes normal BFS routing after a yield maneuver.

`_advance_replanning_robot()` retries a different local yield step if the current yield step stays blocked for 2+ ticks.

`_release_conflict()` clears the pair record when the yielder moves.

`_clear_conflicts_for_robot()` removes stale conflicts when a robot begins a task, arrives, interrupts, fails, or starts charging.

This is a local deadlock-recovery mechanism.

It is not reservation-based multi-agent pathfinding and does not implement intersection control.

### v0.4 Yield Score Additions

`_yield_score()` still uses idle status, task priority, and blocked time.

Battery urgency reduces willingness to yield.

Critical battery robots are strongly protected from unnecessary yielding.

Failed, repairing, and actively charging robots cannot yield.

Battery is one factor, not the only factor.

### v0.6 Zone Locks, `zone_locks`

Proactive path-corridor zone locks on top of reactive local yield.

Each tick, `tick()` rebuilds zone locks from each robot's current path.

Claims the next `lookahead` cells, default 2, on each robot's path.

Robots are sorted by `_yield_score()`; less willing to yield claims first.

`allow_step()` denies a step if the target cell is locked by another robot.

Starvation fallback:

```text
blocked_ticks >= blocked_replan_threshold_ticks * 2
```

Failed, repairing, and charging robots do not create claims.

Diagnostic counters:

```text
denied_steps
locks_created
tick_calls
robots_with_paths
```

### v0.6 Priority Reservation, `priority_reservation`

Approximate prioritized reservation-based conflict management on top of reactive local yield.

Each tick, `tick()` rebuilds vertex reservations from each robot's current path using a `ReservationTable`.

Robots are sorted by a priority score.

Higher-priority robots reserve first.

Priority score considers:

```text
robot mode
task priority
loaded status
battery urgency
blocked time
```

`allow_step()` denies a step if the target cell is reserved by another robot at the next tick.

Starvation fallback:

```text
blocked_ticks >= blocked_replan_threshold_ticks * 2
```

Failed, repairing, and charging robots do not create reservations.

Diagnostic counters:

```text
denied_steps
reservations_created
tick_calls
robots_with_paths
```

This is not full space-time MAPF.

It is a practical proactive traffic manager for experimentation.

## Battery / Charging / Failure Behavior, v0.4.0

### Battery Simulation

Every robot has a battery value.

Battery decreases only from actual successful movement.

Loaded movement consumes more energy than empty movement.

Battery cannot become negative.

Battery feasibility includes a safety margin.

Initial route estimates are not guaranteed to remain valid.

### Battery-Aware Routing

When a task is assigned, the simulation estimates whether the route is battery-feasible.

During execution, the simulation estimates energy required to complete the current remaining route.

Battery feasibility is re-evaluated after:

```text
task assignment
arrival at pickup
successful movement
route resumption
yield-step assignment
replanning or detours
```

If the remaining task becomes infeasible, the robot interrupts the task and seeks charging.

The robot must not blindly continue until battery reaches zero.

### Charging Decisions

Critical battery:

```text
If battery <= critical threshold, the robot seeks charging.
If active task cannot be safely finished, the task is interrupted.
Critical charging has priority over opportunistic charging.
```

Insufficient for task:

```text
If remaining battery < estimated remaining task energy + safety margin, the task is interrupted.
Task state is preserved.
The robot goes to charging.
After charging, the robot may reclaim the task if it is still unassigned.
Another robot may claim the interrupted task before then.
```

Opportunistic charging:

Idle robots may charge if:

```text
they have no task
they have been idle for idle_ticks_before_opportunistic_charge
battery is below opportunistic_charge_threshold
charger capacity is available
a usable charging cell is available
```

Idle robots do not charge immediately.

### Charging Station Behavior

Charging station has finite logical capacity.

Default capacity is 4 robots.

Charging duration is configurable.

Active charging robots occupy slots.

Reserved robots occupy slots while traveling to charge.

Waiting robots do not occupy slots.

Waiting robots should not stand on charging cells.

If a waiting robot is on a charging cell and cannot charge, it is relocated off the charging cell.

When capacity opens, waiting robots are dispatched deterministically.

### Task Interruption / Reassignment

Task interruption reasons:

```text
critical_battery
insufficient_for_task
no_feasible_route
empty_battery
failure
```

Interrupt behavior:

```text
The task is preserved.
Task progress/state is preserved.
The robot is removed from the task.
The task becomes Interrupted.
The task becomes claimable by another robot.
The original robot remembers the interrupted task and may reclaim it after charging/repair if it is still unassigned.
Normal traffic conflicts do not automatically interrupt tasks.
```

Load behavior:

```text
If interrupted before pickup, load remains On shelf.
If interrupted while carrying, load becomes Staged at a logical resume location.
If another robot claims the resumed task, it routes to the resume location, then to dropoff.
```

This is operational/logical recovery, not detailed physical pallet handling.

### Empty Battery Behavior

If battery reaches zero:

```text
active task is interrupted
robot becomes failed/down
robot is relocated to maintenance if enabled
robot remains down for at least empty_battery_recovery_ticks
after recovery, battery is restored
```

### Failure / Repair Behavior

Random failures are optional and controlled by `FailureConfig.enabled`.

`mtbf_ticks` controls average ticks between failures.

`mttr_ticks` controls repair duration.

Failed robots stop moving and stop executing tasks.

Failed robots cannot yield.

Failed robots remain occupied cells unless relocated.

If `relocate_to_maintenance` is true, failed/dead robots are moved/towed to a `MAINTENANCE` cell.

After repair, robots return to service.

After repair, robots may reclaim their interrupted task if still available.

If no task is reclaimed and the robot is on a maintenance cell, it tries to move out of maintenance.

Executes N identical experiment configurations with different seeds.
Each trial writes a normal immutable run artifact to data/runs/<run_id>/.
Monte Carlo derived artifacts are written to data/monte_carlo/<mc_id>/.
force_fast_mode is True by default because Monte Carlo should be headless.
fast_mode only removes wall-clock pacing and does not change simulation results.
summary.json contains errors when trials fail.
results.csv contains per-trial metrics.
Aggregate includes mean, standard deviation, min, p05, median, p95, max, and normal-approximation confidence intervals for mean KPIs.
SLA statistics include both task_late_probability and run_any_violation_probability.
```

SLA metric interpretation:

```text
task_late_probability is the fraction of completed tasks that violated the SLA target.
run_any_violation_probability is the fraction of Monte Carlo trials where at least one task violated the SLA target.
task_late_probability is usually the more operationally meaningful SLA metric.

Writes results.csv, tornado.csv, and summary.json.
Each non-reused sensitivity trial writes a normal immutable run artifact to data/runs/<run_id>/.
Tornado output is sorted by absolute delta.
Default tornado targets are cost_per_task and p95_cycle_time.
OAT sensitivity does not reveal interaction effects.

CLI:

```bash
python -m decision.optimizer --config <optimizer_config.json>
```

Common options:

```text
--n-trials
--reps
--base-seed
--timeout
--cost-config
```

Important behavior:

```text
Uses Optuna TPESampler.
Uses constrained optimization through Optuna constraints_func.
constraints_func is marked experimental by Optuna. The warning is expected.
Evaluates each trial with reps replications.
Use reps: 1 for cheap exploration.
Use robustness verification before deploying any optimizer result.
Writes data/optimizations/<opt_id>/summary.json.
Explicitly reports feasible_count and infeasible_count.
best_trial is selected from feasible trials only.
best_trial is null when no feasible trial exists.
```

Primary supported constraints:

```text
p95_cycle_time_max
sla_compliance_rate_min
```

Constraint semantics:

```text
p95_cycle_time_max is satisfied when p95_cycle_time <= limit.
sla_compliance_rate_min is satisfied when sla_compliance_rate >= limit.
```

Supported objective metrics:

```text
cost_per_task
p95_cycle_time
average_throughput
tasks_completed
```

`cost_per_task` requires a `CostConfig`.

Example optimizer config:

```json
{
  "from_run_id": "<run_id>",
  "objective": "cost_per_task",
  "direction": "minimize",
  "n_trials": 20,
  "reps": 1,

python -m decision.multiobjective --config <multiobjective_config.json>
```

Common options:

```text
--n-trials
--reps
--base-seed
--timeout
--cost-config
```

Important behavior:

```text
Uses Optuna NSGAIISampler.
Supports multiple objectives.
Typical use is minimizing cost_per_task while minimizing p95_cycle_time.
Uses cheap single-replica evaluations by default.
Feasibility is evaluated after simulation.
The Pareto front is extracted from feasible trials only.
If feasible_count is zero, the search space or constraints are too strict.
Writes summary.json, trials.json, and pareto.csv.
summary.json includes base_config and cost_config so robustness verification can inherit them.
Pareto candidates are not deployable until verified by decision/robustness.py.
```

Constraint key convention in multi-objective and robustness modules:

```text
<metric>_max
<metric>_min
```

Examples:

```text
p95_cycle_time_max
sla_compliance_rate_min
cost_per_task_max
total_blocked_ticks_max
average_cycle_time_max
```

Constraint satisfaction rule:

```text
For <metric>_max, value <= limit.
For <metric>_min, value >= limit.
```

Allowed metrics for objectives and generic constraints:

```text
cost_per_task
p95_cycle_time
average_cycle_time
average_throughput
tasks_completed
sla_compliance_rate
total_blocked_ticks
```

Example multi-objective config:

```

CLI:

```bash
python -m decision.robustness --config <robustness_config.json>
```

Common options:

```text
--reps
--base-seed
--min-pass-probability
```

Important behavior:

```text
Verifies candidate configurations under stochastic variation.
Runs each candidate with many seeds.
reps: 20 is the practical minimum for deployment decisions.
Uses the same seed set across candidates for paired comparison.
Calculates constraint_pass_probability for each candidate.
constraint_pass_probability is the fraction of replications satisfying all constraints.
A candidate is robust_pass when constraint_pass_probability >= min_pass_probability.
recommended is null when no candidate meets min_pass_probability.
Writes results.csv and summary.json.
Each replication writes a normal immutable run artifact to data/runs/<run_id>/.
```

Candidate sources:

```text
Explicit candidates list in robustness config.
from_multiobjective path pointing to a multi-objective summary.json.
Multi-objective Pareto trials can be selected automatically.
Single-objective best_trial can be used if present in an optimizer summary.
```

Important robustness rule:

```text
Do not deploy single-replica optimizer or Pareto candidates without robustness verification.
```

Example robustness config:

```json
{
  "from_multiobjective": "data/multiobjective/<study_id>/summary.json",
  "max_candidates": 3,
  "reps": 20,
  "base_seed": 123,

  "cost_config": "cost_config.json",
  "sla_target_ticks": 300
}
```

### `decision/web.py`, NEW in v0.8.2

Purpose:

```text
Expose decision artifacts as controlled read-only JSON APIs.
```

Important factory:

```python
create_decision_blueprint(
    data_dir: Path | str,
    runs_dir: Path | str,
) -> Blueprint
```

Important internal helpers:

```text
_is_safe_id()
_sanitize()
_read_json()
_generated_at_for_dir()
_dir_artifact_summary()
_reports_summary()
_read_csv_page()
_page_args()
_cost_config_from_request()
_list_artifact_dirs()
_get_artifact_dir()
_read_summary()
_paginate_list()
_read_json_list()
_load_trials_from_artifact()
_load_tornado_payload()
```

Important behavior:

```text
Reads saved artifacts only.
Validates IDs.
Sanitizes JSON.
Paginates large tables.
Does not send full CSV files.
Does not modify run artifacts.
Does not compute decision math.
```

ID validation pattern:

```text
^[A-Za-z0-9_\-]+$
```

Sanitization rules:

```text
NaN -> null
Infinity -> null
numpy scalars -> native Python values where possible
Path -> POSIX string
dataclasses -> dict
```

---

### `decision/jobs.py`, NEW in v0.8.2

Purpose:

```text
Run decision-layer jobs separately from the live experiment runner.
```

Important classes:

```python
DecisionJob
DecisionJobManager
DecisionJobError
DecisionJobNotFoundError
DecisionJobConflictError
```

Important factory:

```python
create_decision_jobs_blueprint(manager: DecisionJobManager) -> Blueprint
```

Supported job modules:

```text
study
report
spatial
monte_carlo
sensitivity
optimizer
multiobjective
robustness
```

Module constant:

```python
SUPPORTED_DECISION_JOB_MODULES
```

Current concurrency policy:

```text
one decision job at a time
```

Current cancellation policy:

```text
queued jobs can be cancelled
running jobs cannot be cancelled yet
finished/failed/cancelled jobs cannot be cancelled
```

Current persistence policy:

```text
job state is in-memory only
job list is lost on Flask restart
generated artifacts remain on disk
```

Important rule:

```text
Decision jobs must not reuse the live experiment holder.
```

The live holder remains:

```python
holder = {
    "simulation": ...,
    "runner": ...
}
```

Decision jobs may internally use backend decision modules that execute experiments, but they must not hijack the interactive experiment runner.

---

## Experiment Lifecycle, v0.5.0

User defines `ExperimentConfig` through UI form or JSON.

```text
POST /api/experiment/start
unique run_id created
run directory created
config.json saved
Simulation created from config
Simulation is not started directly
MetricsRecorder attached
runner drives sim._tick() under sim._lock
recorder writes one time-series row plus inferred events per tick
stop condition reached
recorder closed
summary.json written
visualization and analysis read saved files only
```

The runner does not call `Simulation.start()`.

It drives `_tick()` directly in its own daemon thread.

It sleeps `tick_interval` between ticks in normal mode.

In fast mode it yields only.

---

## Reproducibility And Seeding

Rule:

```text
same config + same seed = same result
```

The seed controls:

```text
TaskGenerator(warehouse, seed=seed) location selection.
failure RNG, FailureConfig.seed / Simulation(seed=...).
robot spawn positions, seeded shuffle of passable cells in experiment/factory.generate_spawn_positions().
```

No global RNG reliance.

No new randomness introduced in v0.5+.

`fast_mode` removes wall-clock pacing only.

Tick semantics and results are identical in live and fast mode.

Monte Carlo and robustness modules generate deterministic seed lists when `base_seed` is provided.

If explicit seeds are provided, they are used directly.

---

## Stopping Conditions

`stop_mode = "fixed_ticks"`:

```text
Run until max_ticks.
Answers: how much work is completed in the same time?
```

`stop_mode = "workload"`:

```text
Run until target_tasks completed.
max_ticks is the safety horizon.
Answers: how long does the same workload take?
```

`stop_reason` values written to summary.json:

```text
target_reached
max_ticks_reached
stopped_by_user
reset_by_user
error: <message>
```

---

## Fast / Headless Mode

`ExperimentConfig.fast_mode: bool = False`

When true:

```text
ExperimentRunner does not sleep tick_interval.
It yields with time.sleep(0) periodically.
tick_interval is untouched.
results remain reproducible.
```

UI:

```text
Setup checkbox cfg-fast-mode.
Start shows view-fast with progress text fast-status and fast-stop-btn.
On finish the poller auto-transitions to Results.
```

Recorded as metadata in config.json and summary.json as `fast_mode`.

Fast mode pins one CPU core for its duration. That is expected.

Monte Carlo, sensitivity, optimization, multi-objective, and robustness modules usually force `fast_mode` True because they are headless decision-layer workflows.

---

## Run Identity And Storage Format

run_id format:

```text
YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<6 hex>
```

Example:

```text
20260821_013526_a83f21
```

Runs are never overwritten.

`display_name` is metadata only.

---

## Run Storage

```text
data/
└── runs/
    └── <run_id>/
        ├── config.json
        ├── timeseries.csv

        ├── study_config.json
        ├── results.csv
        └── report.md
```

`results.csv` carries a `run_id` column so each study row traces back to:

```text
data/runs/<run_id>/
```

---

## Report Storage, NEW in v0.7.2

```text
data/
└── reports/
    └── <run_id>_report.md

```text
data/
└── monte_carlo/
    └── <mc_id>/
        ├── results.csv

data/runs/<run_id>/
```

---

## Sensitivity Storage, NEW in v0.8.0

```text
data/
└── sensitivity/
    └── <study_id>/
        ├── results.csv
        ├── tornado.csv
        └── summary.json
```

Each sensitivity trial also writes a normal immutable run artifact under:

```text
data/runs/<run_id>/
```

---

## Optimization Storage, NEW in v0.8.1

```text
data/
└── optimizations/
    └── <opt_id>/
        └── summary.json
```

Each optimization trial may write normal immutable run artifacts under:

```text
data/runs/<run_id>/
```

---

## Multi-Objective Storage, NEW in v0.8.1

```text
data/
└── multiobjective/
    └── <study_id>/
        ├── summary.json
        ├── trials.json
        └── pareto.csv
```

Each multi-objective trial may write normal immutable run artifacts under:

```text
data/runs/<run_id>/
```

---

## Robustness Verification Storage, NEW in v0.8.1

```text
data/
└── robustness/
    └── <robust_id>/
        ├── results.csv
        └── summary.json
```

Each robustness replication writes a normal immutable run artifact under:

```text
data/runs/<run_id>/
```

---

## config.json keys

config.json keys use snake_case because they map directly to ExperimentConfig fields.

Primary keys:

```text
seed

tick_interval
fast_mode
blocked_replan_seconds
replan_cooldown_ticks

battery_safety_margin
empty_battery_recovery_ticks
charger_capacity
charge_duration_ticks
failure_enabled

```

New v0.7.1 keys:

```text
demand_mode
demand_rate_per_tick
demand_task_weights
demand_segments

```

---

## timeseries.csv headers

One row per tick:

```text
tick
tasks_pending
tasks_outstanding
tasks_created_this_tick
tasks_completed_this_tick
tasks_completed_total
tasks_failed_total
robots_active
robots_idle
robots_blocked
robots_charging
robots_to_charger
robots_waiting_for_charger
robots_failed
average_battery
min_battery
max_battery
replans_this_tick
replans_total
blocked_ticks_this_tick
blocked_ticks_total
```

Definitions:

```text
tasks_pending = live tasks with status Pending, unassigned only.
tasks_outstanding = generated - completed - failed.
tasks_outstanding includes Pending, Assigned, and Interrupted tasks.
tasks_outstanding never counts completed tasks awaiting pruning.
```

Robot buckets are mutually exclusive and sum to the robot population.

Robot bucket priority:

```text
failed/repairing > charging > waiting-for-charger > blocked > to-charger > active > idle
```

```text
throughput[t] = tasks_completed_this_tick
```

Averages and rolling windows exist only in the analysis layer.

---

## events.csv headers

```text
run_id
tick
event_type
robot_id
task_id
details
```

Missing fields are empty strings, never invented.

As of v0.7.2:

```text
robot_blocked rows carry {"x": ..., "y": ...} JSON in details.
The coordinates represent the cell occupied when blocking started.
Pre-v0.7.2 runs have empty details on robot_blocked rows.
```

Event types:

```text
task_created
task_assigned
task_completed
task_failed
task_interrupted
task_reassigned
robot_blocked
robot_unblocked
robot_replanned
robot_started_charging
robot_finished_charging
robot_waiting_for_charger
robot_faulted
robot_recovered
```

Known limitation:

```text
multiple transitions inside one tick can be coalesced.
```

Live task pruning never deletes history.

CSVs are written independently.

---

## summary.json keys

```text
run_id
seed
scheduler
stop_reason
fast_mode
simulation_ticks
simulation_seconds
robot_count
tasks_created
tasks_assigned
tasks_completed
tasks_failed
average_throughput
average_wait_time
average_cycle_time
average_robot_utilization
total_replans
total_blocked_ticks
blocked_time_seconds
charging_events
total_charging_ticks
charger_wait_ticks
charger_wait_events
battery_task_interruptions

task_reassignments
failed_robot_events
failure_downtime_ticks
robot_utilization
robot_busy_ticks
robot_total_ticks
robot_blocked_ticks
robot_distance_travelled
```

Summary is for quick comparison; the CSVs are authoritative.

max_ticks >= 1.
tick_interval > 0.
failure_enabled requires mtbf_ticks > 0.
path_planner must be in PATH_PLANNER_CHOICES.
conflict_manager must be in CONFLICT_MANAGER_CHOICES.

## experiment/factory.py, UPDATED in v0.7.1

`ROBOT_COLORS: list[str]` — Okabe-Ito-style palette, cycled by index.

Functions:

```text
generate_spawn_positions(num_robots, warehouse, seed) -> list[tuple[int,int]]
create_experiment_robots(num_robots, warehouse, seed) -> list[Robot]
create_path_planner_from_name(name: str) -> PathPlanner
create_scheduler_from_name(name: str, path_planner: PathPlanner) -> Scheduler
create_conflict_manager_from_name(name: str, sim: Simulation) -> ConflictManager
create_path_planner(config: ExperimentConfig) -> PathPlanner
create_scheduler(config: ExperimentConfig, path_planner: PathPlanner) -> Scheduler
create_conflict_manager(config: ExperimentConfig, sim: Simulation) -> ConflictManager
create_task_generator(config: ExperimentConfig, warehouse: Warehouse) -> TaskGenerator
create_simulation_from_config(config) -> Simulation
```

Important behavior:

```text
generate_spawn_positions() collects passable cells, shuffles with random.Random(seed), takes N. ValueError if fewer passable cells than requested.
create_experiment_robots() creates ids R1..RN, clean strings, deterministic seeded positions.
create_simulation_from_config() builds the warehouse via decision.layout.create_warehouse_for_experiment(), builds the task generator via create_task_generator(), builds robots, configs, path planner, scheduler, and injects conflict manager via sim.set_conflict_manager().
```

---

## experiment/recorder.py, UPDATED in v0.7.2

```python
MetricsRecorder(run_dir: str, run_id: str)
```

Public:

```text
record(snapshot: dict)
close()
```

Important behavior:

```text
Opens timeseries.csv and events.csv.
Writes headers.
Flushes periodically.
close() flushes and closes.
Receives primitive snapshots only.
Never stores live object references.
record() writes one time-series row.
It then infers task/robot events by diffing previous-tick primitive state.
```

Internal previous state fields:

```text
_prev_metrics
_prev_tasks
_prev_robots
```

Completed/failed tasks are dropped from `_prev_tasks` only after being seen Completed/Failed.

`robot_unblocked` is suppressed when caused by failed/repairing/charging/waiting transitions.

As of v0.7.2:

```text
robot_blocked events write {"x": ..., "y": ...} JSON into the details column.
The coordinates represent the cell occupied when blocking started.
```

---

## experiment/runner.py, UPDATED in v0.7.2

```python
ExperimentRunner(base_dir: str = "data/runs")
```

Properties:

```text
is_active
finished
```

Public methods:

```text
start(config, sim_factory) -> run_id
stop(reason="stopped_by_user")
get_state() -> dict
get_summary() -> dict | None
```

Important behavior:

```text
start() creates run dir, saves config, creates recorder, calls sim.resume(), starts daemon thread. RuntimeError if a run is active.
stop() sets stop reason, calls sim.stop(), joins.
get_state() returns {active, finished, runId, runDir, stopReason, paused, tick, fastMode}.
get_summary() returns in-memory summary or reads summary.json.
```

Internal:

```text
_run() loops while not sim._stop_event, skips while sim.is_paused, under sim._lock calls _tick(), _snapshot(), recorder.record(), and evaluates stop condition.
Pacing: fast_mode -> time.sleep(0) every 500 ticks; normal mode -> time.sleep(sim._tick_interval).
Exceptions set stop_reason = "error: ...".
_snapshot() extracts primitive metrics counters, per-task fields, and per-robot fields including x and y.
_evaluate_stop_condition() implements fixed_ticks and workload stopping.
_finalize() closes recorder, computes and writes summary.json once.
```

## analysis/loader.py, NEW in v0.5.0

```python
DEFAULT_RUNS_DIR = "data/runs"
```

`RunData` dataclass:

```text
run_id
run_dir
config
summary
timeseries
events
```

Functions:

```text
list_runs(base_dir) -> list[dict]
load_run(run_id, base_dir) -> RunData
```

Important behavior:

```text
list_runs returns newest first.
Each entry contains run_id, run_dir, config, summary.
load_run raises FileNotFoundError if the run is missing.
```

```

`ensure_derived_timeseries(df)`:

```text
Adds tick if absent.
Adds tasks_completed_total cumsum if absent.
Adds throughput = tasks_completed_this_tick.
Adds throughput_rolling_50.
Adds throughput_rolling_100.

## analysis/web.py, NEW in v0.5.0

Important names:

```text
RUN_ID_PATTERN = ^[A-Za-z0-9_\-]+$
DEFAULT_MAX_POINTS = 2000
MAX_POINTS_LIMIT = 5000
_sanitize()
_downsample(df, column, max_points)

## Flask Layer, UPDATED in v0.8.2

### `app.py`

Important functions:

```python
create_app(
    base_data_dir: str = "data/runs",
    start_simulation: bool = False,
) -> Flask
```

module-level:

```python
app = create_app()
```

Holder pattern:

```python
holder = {
    "simulation": <Simulation>,
    "runner": <ExperimentRunner | None>
}
```

All live state routes read:

```python
holder["simulation"]
```

`create_default_simulation()` is replaced by:

```python
create_simulation_from_config(ExperimentConfig.default())
```

New in v0.8.2:

```python
decision_job_manager = DecisionJobManager(
    data_dir=data_dir,
    runs_dir=base_dir,
    max_workers=1,
)
```

Where:

```python
base_dir = Path(base_data_dir)
data_dir = base_dir.parent
```

For default configuration:

```text
base_dir = data/runs
data_dir = data
```

Registered blueprints new in v0.8.2:

```python
app.register_blueprint(
    create_decision_blueprint(
        data_dir=data_dir,
        runs_dir=base_dir,
    )
)

app.register_blueprint(
    create_decision_jobs_blueprint(decision_job_manager)
)
```

Routes, legacy semantics preserved:

```text
GET /
GET /api/state
POST /api/pause
POST /api/resume
POST /api/reset
```

`GET /api/state` returns the v0.4 payload plus top-level `experiment` key.

If runner present, `experiment` is `runner.get_state()`.

Else:

```json
{
  "active": false,
  "finished": false,
  "runId": null,
  "stopReason": null,
  "fastMode": false
}
```

`POST /api/reset` stops active runner with `reset_by_user` and recreates default simulation.

Routes, v0.5 experiment lifecycle:

```text
POST /api/experiment/start
GET /api/experiment/state
POST /api/experiment/stop
GET /api/experiment/summary
```

Important behavior:

```text
POST /api/experiment/start returns 409 if a run is active.
Returns 400 on validation or spawn errors.
Body is ExperimentConfig JSON, merged over defaults.
Returns {runId}.
Swaps holder simulation/runner.
GET /api/experiment/summary returns 404 without runner; 409 not finished.
```

Routes, v0.5 analysis API:

```text
GET /api/runs
DELETE /api/runs/<run_id>
GET /api/runs/compare/series?runs=a,b&column=...&max_points=...
GET /api/runs/<run_id>/summary
GET /api/runs/<run_id>/series?columns=a,b&max_points=...

Routes, v0.8.2 decision jobs API:

```text
POST /api/decision/jobs
GET /api/decision/jobs
GET /api/decision/jobs/<job_id>
POST /api/decision/jobs/<job_id>/cancel
```

Important behavior:

```text
Routes stay thin.
Business logic lives in simulation/, experiment/, analysis/, and decision/.
The raw data/runs directory is not served statically.
Decision artifacts are not served as raw static files.
```

cancelled
```

Meaning:

```text
queued: accepted but not started
running: currently executing
finished: completed successfully
failed: completed with error
cancelled: cancelled before execution
```

Artifact linkage:

When a job finishes successfully:

```text
artifact_type describes the decision artifact type
artifact_id describes the artifact id
```

Examples:

```text
artifact_type = monte_carlo
artifact_id = <mc_id>

artifact_type = sensitivity
artifact_id = <study_id>

artifact_type = optimization
artifact_id = <opt_id>

artifact_type = multiobjective
artifact_id = <study_id>

artifact_type = robustness
artifact_id = <robust_id>

artifact_type = study
artifact_id = <study_id>

artifact_type = report
artifact_id = <run_id or study_id>

artifact_type = spatial
artifact_id = <run_id>
```

Spatial analysis is computed on demand and does not currently create a dedicated stored artifact directory.

Planned:

```text
GET /api/decision/templates
GET /api/decision/templates/<module>
```

Current frontend behavior:

```text
Job modal supports guided forms for all primary decision modules.

Planned future routes:

```text
GET /api/decision/files/demand-csv
GET /api/decision/files/layouts
GET /api/decision/files/cost-configs
POST /api/decision/files/upload
```

Current file policy:

```text
No arbitrary filesystem paths should be accepted from untrusted users.
Demand CSV and layout file Setup fields are implemented as local trusted relative-path text inputs.
These are acceptable for local single-user development.
For hosted deployments, they must be replaced by admin-managed dropdowns or validated uploads.
Uploads accept only .csv and .json files up to 10 MiB.
Uploads cannot overwrite an existing file with the same name.
Cost config is edited inline as JSON.

## CLI Layer, UPDATED in v0.8.1

### `benchmark.py`

Purpose:

```text
Runs a headless synchronous benchmark.
Does not start Flask.
Does not poll.
Directly calls sim._tick() under the simulation lock.
As of v0.7.2, records every run through ExperimentRunner.
```

Existing arguments:

```text
--robots
--block-replan
--cooldown
--target
--seed
```

v0.4 arguments:

```text
--max-ticks
--battery-capacity
--empty-move-energy
--loaded-move-energy
--critical-battery
--opportunistic-charge-threshold
--idle-opportunistic-ticks
--battery-safety-margin
--charger-capacity
--charge-duration-ticks
--failure-enabled
--mtbf-ticks
--mttr-ticks
```

v0.5 arguments:

```text
--spawn, choices: seeded, legacy; default: seeded
--display-name
```

v0.6 arguments:

```text
--path-planner, choices: bfs, astar, weighted_astar; default: bfs
--scheduler, choices: baseline, priority, fifo, total_cost, auction; default: baseline
--conflict-manager, choices: local_yield, zone_locks, priority_reservation; default: local_yield
```

Important behavior:

```text
Benchmark wall-clock times are not comparable to pre-v0.7.2 runs due to recording overhead.
```

Examples:

```bash
python benchmark.py \
  --robots 8 \
  --seed 42 \
  --target 200 \
  --path-planner astar \
  --scheduler priority \
  --conflict-manager priority_reservation
```

```bash
python benchmark.py \
  --robots 8 \
  --seed 42 \
  --target 200 \
  --failure-enabled \
  --mtbf-ticks 1500 \
  --mttr-ticks 25
```

### `optimize_optuna.py`

Purpose:

```text
Legacy Optuna parameter optimizer.
Prefer decision/optimizer.py, decision/multiobjective.py, and decision/robustness.py for v0.8.1 workflows.
```

Existing search parameters:

```text
num_robots
blocked_replan_seconds
replan_cooldown_ticks
```

Existing arguments:

```text
--trials
--target
--max-ticks
--base-seed
--objective
--fixed-robots
--db
```

v0.4 arguments:

```text
--search-v04
plus battery/charging/failure parameter set.
```

Important behavior:

```text
Without --search-v04, optimization behavior remains v0.3-style but runs with v0.4 battery/charging defaults.
With --search-v04, selected battery/charging parameters are included in the search space.
v0.4 metrics are logged as Optuna user attributes.
Study name includes a v0.4 suffix when --search-v04 is used.
```

---

## Decision CLI, UPDATED in v0.8.1

Study:

```bash
python -m decision.study --config <study_config.json>
```

Report:

```bash
python -m decision.report --study-dir <study_dir>
python -m decision.report --run-id <run_id> [--base-dir DIR]
```

Spatial:

```bash
python -m decision.spatial --run-id <run_id> [--base-dir DIR] [--top N] [--by blocked_ticks|blocked_events] [--json]
```

Monte Carlo:

```bash
python -m decision.monte_carlo --config <base_config.json> --n <runs>
python -m decision.monte_carlo --from-run-id <run_id> --n <runs>
```

Sensitivity:

```bash
python -m decision.sensitivity --config <sensitivity_config.json>
```

Single-objective optimization:

```bash
python -m decision.optimizer --config <optimizer_config.json>
```

Multi-objective optimization:

```bash
python -m decision.multiobjective --config <multiobjective_config.json>
```

Robustness verification:

```bash
python -m decision.robustness --config <robustness_config.json>
```

---

## Frontend Structure, NEW in v0.8.2

The frontend was refactored from monolithic files into modular files.

Old monolithic files, deprecated:

```text
templates/index.html as a single giant file
static/style.css as a single giant file
static/simulation.js as a single giant file
```

New structure:

```text
templates/
├── index.html
├── views/
│   ├── setup.html
│   ├── run.html
│   ├── fast.html
│   ├── results.html
│   ├── experiments.html
│   ├── visualization.html
│   ├── analysis.html
│   ├── compare.html
│   └── decision.html
└── modals/
    └── job_modal.html

static/
├── css/
│   ├── theme.css
│   ├── layout.css
│   ├── warehouse.css
│   └── decision.css
└── js/
    ├── utils.js
    ├── state.js
    ├── charts.js
    ├── warehouse.js
    ├── experiments.js
    ├── decision.js
    └── app.js
```

Important note:

```text
The ECharts wrapper module is static/js/charts.js.
If a local file was accidentally named chart.js, it must be renamed to charts.js or the script tag must be corrected.
```

---

## Frontend Script Load Order

The script load order matters.

Correct order:

```html
<script src="/static/js/utils.js"></script>
<script src="/static/js/state.js"></script>
<script src="/static/js/charts.js"></script>
<script src="/static/js/warehouse.js"></script>
<script src="/static/js/experiments.js"></script>
<script src="/static/js/decision.js"></script>
<script src="/static/js/app.js"></script>
```

ECharts must load before the JS modules that render charts.

Correct external dependency:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/echarts@5/dist/echarts.min.js"></script>
```

For offline or air-gapped hosts:

```html
<script src="/static/vendor/echarts.min.js"></script>
```

---

formatValue
formValue
formNumber
formNumberOrNull
formBool
decisionFetchJson
flattenRow
deriveColumns
formatMoney
formatPercent
formatProbability
on
```

### `static/js/state.js`

Application state and shared infrastructure.

Important globals:

```text
CELL_SIZE
POLL_INTERVAL_MS
CHART_COLORS
views
currentView
activeRunId
robotElements
previousWarehouseKey
updateInProgress
visualizationChart
compareChart
analysisCharts
compareMultiSelect
decisionSubview
jobPollingInterval
```

Important functions:

```text
initViews
showView
createMetricCard
createTaskRow
refresh
populateRunSelects
```

Important class:

```text
MultiSelect
```

### `static/js/charts.js`

ECharts wrappers.

Important functions:

```text
ensureECharts
getBaseChartOption
renderLineChart
renderStackedAreaChart
renderBarChart
renderHistogramChart
```

`ensureECharts` fails loudly if ECharts is not loaded.

### `static/js/warehouse.js`

Live warehouse rendering.

Important functions:

```text
staticWarehouseKey
render
buildStaticLayer
addCell
updateRobots
updateTaskHighlights
highlightLocation
addTileClass
updateSidePanel
```

### `static/js/experiments.js`

Experiment lifecycle and old analysis views.

Important functions:

```text
readExperimentConfig
startExperiment
showResults
renderSummary
openRunSummary
loadExperiments
generateVisualization
generateAnalysis
generateComparison
updateResultsDecisionActionsVisibility
createRunActionButton
createRunLinkedActionsGroup
```

`readExperimentConfig()` includes:

```text
display_name
seed
num_robots
stop_mode
target_tasks
max_ticks
tick_interval
fast_mode
blocked_replan_seconds
replan_cooldown_ticks
path_planner
scheduler
conflict_manager
battery fields
charging fields
failure fields
```

Implemented Setup v0.7.1 fields:

```text
demand_mode
demand_rate_per_tick
demand_task_weights
demand_segments
demand_csv_path
demand_events
layout_preset
layout_file
```

`readExperimentConfig()` includes these fields using backend snake_case keys.

Setup validation helpers may include:

```text
parseSetupJson
parseSetupJsonObject
parseSetupJsonArray
validateNonNegativeNumberObject
validateRelativeTrustedPath
validateDemandSegments
validateDemandEvents
```

Phase 3 helpers may include:

```text
updateResultsDecisionActionsVisibility
createRunActionButton

```

### `static/js/decision.js`

Decision Center logic.

Important functions:

```text
decisionContainer

buildRunLinkedSearchSpace
buildRunLinkedConfig
fetchRunSummarySafe
showRunActionError
prepareDecisionRunSelect
goToCostKpisForRun
goToSpatialForRun
openRunLinkedJobModal

```

Phase 3 run-linked behavior:

`handleRunLinkedAction` handles buttons using `data-run-action`.
Cost and spatial actions navigate to existing read-only Decision subviews.
Report, Monte Carlo, sensitivity, optimizer, and multi-objective actions open the decision job modal with a prefilled JSON config.
Phase 3 run-linked prefill remains JSON-based.
Phase 4 guided forms do not reverse-parse arbitrary prefilled JSON.

### `static/js/decision_forms.js`, NEW in v0.8.3

## Setup v0.7.1 Demand and Layout Fields, NEW in v0.8.3

Setup now supports the v0.7.1 experiment fields required for realistic non-CLI scenarios.

Demand fields:

```text
demand_mode
demand_rate_per_tick
demand_task_weights
demand_segments
demand_csv_path
demand_events
```

Layout fields:

```text
layout_preset
layout_file
```

Recommended DOM IDs:

```text
cfg-demand-mode
cfg-demand-rate-per-tick
cfg-demand-task-weights
cfg-demand-segments
cfg-demand-csv-file
cfg-demand-events
cfg-layout-preset
cfg-layout-file
```

Conditional demand behavior:

```text
If demand_mode = legacy: show no additional demand fields.
If demand_mode = uniform: show demand_rate_per_tick and demand_task_weights.
If demand_mode = rate_schedule: show demand_segments.
If demand_mode = csv_orders: show demand_csv_path and demand_events.
```

`readExperimentConfig()` must send these fields using backend snake_case keys.

Demand validation behavior:

```text
demand_rate_per_tick must be a finite number >= 0 when uniform demand is used.
demand_task_weights must be a JSON object with finite non-negative numeric values.
demand_segments must be a JSON array of segment objects.
Each demand segment should include valid start_tick, end_tick, and rate values.
demand_events must be a JSON array of event objects when provided.
demand_csv_path must be a relative trusted path when provided.
```

Layout behavior:

```text
layout_preset supports default, high_density, and one_way_aisles.
layout_file is optional.
```

Important file policy:

```text
Demand CSV and layout file inputs are currently implemented as local trusted relative-path text inputs.
This is acceptable for local single-user development.
For hosted deployments, these inputs must be replaced by admin-managed dropdowns or validated uploads.
Arbitrary server filesystem paths must not be accepted from untrusted users.
Path traversal patterns should be rejected.
```

## Run-Linked Actions, NEW in v0.8.3

Run-linked actions allow a user to start decision workflows from an existing run.

Entry points:

```text
Results view
Experiments list
```

Results DOM contract:

```text
results-decision-actions-card
```

Run-linked action attributes:

```text
data-run-action
data-run-id
```

Supported `data-run-action` values:

```text
cost
spatial
report
monte_carlo
sensitivity
optimizer
multiobjective
```

Behavior:

```text
cost: navigate to Decision -> Cost KPIs and select the run.
spatial: navigate to Decision -> Spatial and select the run.
report: open the decision job modal and prefill report config with the selected run id.
monte_carlo: open the modal and prefill Monte Carlo config using the selected run id.
sensitivity: open the modal and prefill sensitivity config using the selected run id.
optimizer: open the modal and prefill single-objective optimizer config using the selected run as baseline.
multiobjective: open the modal and prefill multi-objective config using the selected run as baseline.
```

Phase 3 configs are JSON-based. After Phase 4, Phase 3 prefilled configs open in Advanced JSON mode. Guided forms do not attempt to reverse-parse arbitrary Phase 3 JSON.

## Guided Decision Job Forms, NEW in v0.8.3

The decision job modal supports guided forms for non-CLI users and an advanced JSON editor for advanced users.

Supported guided modules:

```text
monte_carlo
sensitivity
report
spatial
optimizer
multiobjective
robustness
study
```

Modal behavior:

```text
When guided mode is enabled, render the module-specific guided form and hide the raw JSON editor.
When guided mode is disabled, hide the guided form and show the raw JSON editor.
When a Phase 3 run-linked action supplies a prefilled config object, open the modal in Advanced JSON mode.
```

Guided forms cover:

```text
Monte Carlo source selection, runs, seed, SLA target, and cost config.
Sensitivity source selection, replications, seed, SLA target, cost config, and factor rows.
Report run/study source selection.
Spatial run, top-cell count, and sort mode.
Optimizer objective, direction, trials, replications, cost config, common constraints, and search space.
Multi-objective trials, replications, population size, objectives, constraints, cost config, and search space.
Robustness candidate source, candidate limits, replications, objective, constraints, and cost config.
Study source and factor rows.
```

Monte Carlo validation:

```text
source run or base config required
n_runs >= 1
cost config must be a valid JSON object if provided
```

Sensitivity validation:

```text
source run or base config required
reps >= 1
at least one factor required
each factor requires at least one value
```

Report validation requires a run or study id. Spatial validation requires a run, `top >= 1`, and `sort by` equal to `blocked_ticks` or `blocked_events`.

Optimizer validation requires a source, supported objective, direction equal to `minimize` or `maximize`, `n_trials >= 1`, `reps >= 1`, a non-empty search space, and a cost config when the objective is `cost_per_task`.

Multi-objective validation requires at least two supported objectives, valid directions, a non-empty search space, and a cost config if any objective is `cost_per_task`.

Robustness validation requires a candidate source, `reps >= 1`, `min_pass_probability` between 0 and 1, and a cost config when the objective is `cost_per_task`. Explicit candidates require `label` and `overrides`.

Study validation requires a source, at least one factor, and at least one value per factor.

Supported objective metrics:

```text
cost_per_task
p95_cycle_time
average_cycle_time
average_throughput
tasks_completed
sla_compliance_rate
total_blocked_ticks
```

A robustness warning remains visible when reps are below 20, and a study warning remains visible for large factorial designs.

Important global rule:

```text
Guided forms only build request JSON.
They do not compute decision math.
Backend validation remains authoritative.
```

## Frontend Behavior Rules

### Loading states

Every decision screen must show a loading state before data arrives.

Current implementation:

```text
Loading…
```

### Empty states

Every decision screen must show a readable empty state.

Examples:

```text
No studies found.
No Monte Carlo studies found.
No sensitivity studies found.
No optimization studies found.
No multi-objective studies found.
No robustness studies found.
No active or recent decision jobs.
```

### Error states

Backend errors must be displayed in readable language.

Examples:

```text
Run id not found.
Study not found.
Monte Carlo study not found.
Sensitivity study not found.
Optimization study not found.
Multi-objective study not found.
Robustness study not found.
Job not found.
Unsupported decision module.
Job config must be a JSON object.
```

### Warning states

Important warnings that must remain visible in the UI:

```text
Single-replica optimizer results are exploratory.
Pareto candidates are not deployable until verified by robustness.
One-at-a-time sensitivity does not reveal interaction effects.
Pre-v0.7.2 spatial coverage is 0.0.
reps below 20 is not recommended for deployment decisions.
No feasible optimizer solution is a valid result.
```

---

## Decision UI Interpretation Rules

### Monte Carlo SLA metrics

The UI must distinguish:

```text
task_late_probability
run_any_violation_probability
```

Do not present them as the same metric.

### Optimizer best trial

The UI must show:

```text
best_trial only when it exists
```

If `best_trial` is null:

```text
No feasible solution found.
```

Do not show an infeasible trial as best.

### Multi-objective Pareto candidates

Pareto candidates are candidate configurations, not deployable recommendations.

The UI must show:

```text
Pareto candidates are not deployable until verified by robustness.
```

### Robustness recommendation

The UI must show recommended candidate only when backend provides one.

If `recommended` is null:

```text
No candidate met the required constraint pass probability.
```

---

## Frontend JavaScript Historical Note

Previous API_SURFACE versions contained:

```text
Frontend JavaScript, UPDATED in v0.6.0, UNCHANGED in v0.8.x
```

That statement is superseded by v0.8.2.

The old monolithic `static/simulation.js` is deprecated.

Its responsibilities are preserved in the new modular frontend files:

```text
static/js/utils.js
static/js/state.js
static/js/charts.js
static/js/warehouse.js
static/js/experiments.js
static/js/decision.js
static/js/app.js
```

Old v0.5/v0.6 DOM IDs and functions remain conceptually preserved, but the current source of truth is the modular frontend structure.

---

## UI / Visualization, UPDATED in v0.8.2

Existing UI workflow remains:

```text
Setup
Run
Fast
Results
Experiments
Visualization
Analysis
Compare
```

New Decision workflow added:

```text
Decision
├── Overview
├── Studies
├── Reports
├── Spatial
├── Cost KPIs
├── Monte Carlo
├── Sensitivity
├── Optimization
├── Multi-Objective
├── Robustness
└── Jobs
```

Decision views must not compute decision math.

Decision views must read backend JSON only.

Decision views must handle:

```text
loading
empty
error
success
partial success
```

Decision views must show warnings for exploratory or non-deployable results.

---

## Security Rules, UPDATED in v0.8.2

Decision jobs can create expensive CPU and disk work.

Required protections:

```text
ID validation
no arbitrary filesystem paths
no raw static serving of data directories
upload validation if uploads are added
request size limits
rate limiting for job creation in hosted deployments
authentication for hosted deployments
authorization for job submission
concurrency limits
```

ID validation pattern:

```text
^[A-Za-z0-9_\-]+$
```

Do not build filesystem paths directly from unvalidated user input.

Current job manager concurrency:

```text
max_workers = 1
```

---

## Deployment Notes, UPDATED in v0.8.2

Serve with:

```bash
gunicorn app:app
```

or platform equivalent.

Never use the Flask development server when hosted.

`data/runs/` must be on persistent storage.

Ephemeral filesystems lose experiments on restart.

Decision job state is also in-memory in v0.8.2, so Flask restarts lose the active job list.

ECharts may load from CDN or be vendored at:

```text
static/vendor/echarts.min.js
```

For offline or air-gapped hosts, vendor ECharts.

If the public can start experiments or decision jobs, add:

```text
authentication
authorization
rate limiting
job concurrency limits
upload validation
request size limits
```

Experiments consume CPU and disk.

Fast mode pins one core for its duration.

Optimization, Monte Carlo, sensitivity, multi-objective, and robustness studies are CPU-intensive.

For production use, consider:

```text
queueing
batch scheduling
dedicated worker processes
persistent job history
```

---

## Engineering Principles for Decision Layer, v0.8.x

Single-replica results are exploratory.

Single-replica optimizer and multi-objective trials are cheap but noisy.

They identify candidate regions. They do not prove operational robustness.

Robustness verification is mandatory before deployment.

Use `decision/robustness.py` with at least `reps: 20` before treating a configuration as deployable.

If a candidate is close to a constraint boundary, use `reps: 30` or more.

`constraint_pass_probability` is the critical deployment metric.

A candidate with the lowest mean `cost_per_task` but a 70% constraint pass probability is not deployable.

A slightly more expensive candidate with 95%+ constraint pass probability is usually preferable.

Pareto fronts are candidate sets.

Multi-objective Pareto fronts show tradeoffs. They are not final answers.

Each Pareto candidate should be robustness-checked.

OAT sensitivity does not show interactions.

One-at-a-time sensitivity identifies local parameter influence. It cannot prove interaction effects.

Use full DoE, multi-objective search, or targeted experiments for interactions.

Infeasible optimization results are valid results.

If `feasible_count` is zero, the optimizer or multi-objective study has proven that the current search space and constraints are incompatible.

Do not relax this silently.

Either widen the search space, relax constraints, or redesign the operational scenario.

Run artifacts remain immutable.

Monte Carlo, sensitivity, optimizer, multi-objective, and robustness modules may create new runs.

They must never modify existing `data/runs/<run_id>/` artifacts.

Frontend must not compute decision math.

Frontend must only render backend-produced decision artifacts.

---

## Recommended v0.8.2 Workflow

The recommended decision workflow is:

```text
1. Define baseline experiment and CostConfig.
2. Run a normal simulation or benchmark and produce data/runs/<run_id>/.
3. Run Monte Carlo to measure baseline variability.
4. Run sensitivity analysis to identify high-impact parameters.
5. Run single-objective optimization to find a cheap feasible configuration.
6. Run multi-objective optimization to explore cost versus cycle-time tradeoffs.
7. Select Pareto or best candidates.
8. Run robustness verification with reps >= 20.
9. Choose the recommended candidate only if constraint_pass_probability meets the required operational risk threshold.
10. Generate engineering reports from the final verified configuration.
```

The v0.8.3 frontend supports this workflow through the Decision Center, Job Launcher, run-linked actions, and guided decision forms.
Advanced decision charts, spatial heatmap overlay, and managed file selection remain pending.
